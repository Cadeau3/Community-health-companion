# 🌿 Community Health Companion  
*A student-built health accessibility tool inspired by caregiving, community need, and a commitment to the Common Good.*

A mobile-friendly website that provides first-aid guidance, essential wellness tips, emergency contacts, and emotional support for caregivers.  
This project represents my effort to turn a personal challenge—caring for my grandmother—into a resource that can support others facing similar responsibilities.

## 🌟 Live Website  
👉 **https://cadeau3.github.io/Community-health-companion/**

Designed to work on any device, especially low-data, low-storage phones common in many communities.

## 💛 Project Motivation  
As a young caregiver, I often found myself navigating medical uncertainty without clear or accessible guidance.  
I learned quickly that in many households, health information is scattered, unreliable, or hidden behind paid services or data-heavy websites.  

This project reflects two core values I hold deeply:

### **1️⃣ A belief in the power of accessible knowledge**  
Accurate information should not depend on wealth, geography, or bandwidth.

### **2️⃣ A commitment to community care**  
Inspired by Bowdoin’s principle of *the Common Good*, I built this tool to make everyday health information understandable and available to anyone who needs it—especially young caregivers balancing school, family, and responsibility.

## 🚀 Future Expansion  
To further support caregivers and families, I plan to integrate:

- Google Maps with clickable clinic markers  
- A mental health support hub  
- A multilingual version (Swahili, Luo, English)  
- A symptom checker tool  
- Offline access for low-connectivity areas  
- A more interactive UI with animations  

Each improvement aligns with my long-term goal:  
**building tools that empower communities through accessible technology.**

## ✨ What This Project Demonstrates  
- **Self-directed learning** — built independently from scratch  
- **Technical initiative** — coding, debugging, deployment, version control  
- **Leadership through service** — creating solutions in response to community needs  
- **Resilience** — shaped by lived experience as a caregiver  
- **Commitment to the Common Good** — a value I hope to continue at Bowdoin  

This project is not just a website—  
It is a reflection of the person I am becoming: someone who uses challenges as a foundation for innovation and empathy.
